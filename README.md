# Fake News Prediction Model

## Overview

The Fake News Prediction Model is a machine learning application designed to classify news articles as either "real" or "fake." This model utilizes various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to assess the authenticity of news content.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text data into numerical features.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Implements several classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict the credibility of news articles.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
